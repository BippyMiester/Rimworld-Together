> [!NOTE]
> This is a list containing all the confirmed mod incompatibilities with Rimworld Together, divided in severities depending on how much they impact the gameplay experience.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is NOT an exhaustive list, there might be other mods that cause issues with Rimworld Together that haven't been documented or confirmed to break.

### Mods that completely break with Rimworld Together:
- [RimSaves](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1713367505) > Since it allows for the creation of local folders for saves, it breaks the path where the mod is supposed to look for a save to upload to the server, therefore not allowing to save at all progress.
- [Zetrith's Multiplayer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2606448745) > Absolutely breaks the game without any possibility of working, since complex multiplayer mods are not meant to work together.
- [My Little Planet](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1117406550) > Breaks world generation and sending the world towards the server for storing, since it modifies the world generation above our patches.
- [Realistic Planets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2557451791) > Breaks world generation and sending the world towards the server for storing, since it modifies the world generation above our patches.
- [Alpha Biomes](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1841354677) > Breaks UI whenever you relog into the server and access the world map.

### Mods that somewhat break with Rimworld Together:
- [SRTS](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1845423808) > Breaks raiding / spying / visiting due to the mod not using vanilla caravan code, similar mods might produce same results.

### Mods that slightly break with Rimworld Together:
- [Roads of the Rim](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1613783924) > No issues other than the roads that are built don't get synced with the server.
- [Vanilla Outposts Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2688941031) > Works completely fine aside from the fact that outposts that generate from this mod aren't synced to everyone else.
